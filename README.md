There are some webcomics and traditional comics publishers who offer samples (or the entirety!) of their work for free. However, many of the interfaces built for reading them aren't the most intuitive. These scripts download the images that have been made available into a local directory and renames them into a common format so that they can be more easily read using a local image viewer.
